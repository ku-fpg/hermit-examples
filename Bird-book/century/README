Note: this case study requires GHC >= 7.8 to run.

First install HERMIT, which can be done via Cabal:

> cabal install hermit

Then install the plugin that contains the Foldr Fusion proof technique:

> cd century-plugin
> cabal install

The Foldr Fusion plugin can be tested by descending into the FoldrFusionExample directory and invoking HERMIT as follows:

> hermit FoldrFusionExample.hs -opt=HERMIT.Dictionary.CenturyPlugin +FoldrFusionExample FoldrFusionExample.hec

To run the entire case study, invoke HERMIT in this directory as follows:

> hermit Century.hs -opt=HERMIT.Dictionary.CenturyPlugin Century.hec

If it runs successfully, you can use the HERMIT command "show-lemmas" to display all the lemmas (which should be noted as proved).

hermit> show-lemmas
