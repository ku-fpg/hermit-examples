First install HERMIT, which can be done via Cabal:

> cabal install hermit

Then install the plugin that contains the Foldr Fusion proof technique:

> cd century-plugin
> cabal install
> cd ..

You should then be able to run the entire case study as follows:

> hermit Century.hs -opt=HERMIT.Dictionary.CenturyPlugin Century.hec

If it runs successfully, you can use the HERMIT command "show-lemmas" to display all the lemmas (which should be noted as proved).

hermit> show-lemmas
