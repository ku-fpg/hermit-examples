The main calculation in the "A Little Theory" has been encoded.  But his main calculation derives a definition of "expand" from the precondition to the fusion law.  I perform this calculation on the side, but it's not in the pipeline from original program to efficient program.  HERMIT doesn't have the infrastructure for proving auxillary equalities.

Added some definitions, but then decided it doesn't make for a good example as there's not much equational reasoning.
